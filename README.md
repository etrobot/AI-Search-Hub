How to Use

To load an unpacked extension in Google Chrome, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Google Chrome on your computer.
2. In the address bar, type `chrome://extensions` and press Enter. This will open the Chrome Extensions page.
3. Enable the "Developer mode" option. You should find a toggle switch at the top right corner of the Extensions page. If it's already enabled, you can skip this step.
4. Download or locate the folder containing the unpacked extension on your computer. Make sure the folder contains all the necessary files for the extension, including the manifest file (`manifest.json`), which is required for every extension.
5. Once you have the folder ready, click on the "Load unpacked" button, which should now be visible on the Extensions page.
6. A file browser window will appear. Navigate to the folder where your extension is located and select it. Then, click the "Select Folder" button.
7. Chrome will load the extension, and you should see it listed among your installed extensions on the Extensions page.

That's it! The unpacked extension should now be loaded in Google Chrome, and you can start using it. Remember to keep the "Developer mode" enabled if you want to load additional unpacked extensions or make changes to the loaded extension.
